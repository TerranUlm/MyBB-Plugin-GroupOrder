# MyBB-Plugin-GroupSort
A plugin for MyBB 1.8.x which allows to sort the users groups in a customizable order. The highest priority group will be the primary group.

The sort order (priority) is the display order in the "groups" section of the ACP. The plugin adds a tab to each group where you can set the priority by number:
* lower number = higher priority, the highest priority group a users is a member of will be his primary and display group.
* This is the same as the "Order" column you can see on the "Groups" page but for all groups, not just the ones marked as "show on forum team page".
